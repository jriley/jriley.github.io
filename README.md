# The Nerdanderthal's Cave Scrawlings

This is a collection of random stuff that I have had in my head at one time or another. This is the place where I go to record them for later use. Quite simply I can not keep all of it in my head there is just way too many interesting things in the world. Rather this makes it into the world as a blog or some form is yet to be determined.
